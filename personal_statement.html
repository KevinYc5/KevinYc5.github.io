<h1>Personal statement</h1>
</div>
<p>Nobel Laureate in Chemistry William Lipscomb once said: “With a Ph.D. you will have a better chance of spending the rest of your life doing what you want to do,
    instead of what someone else wants you to do.” I couldn’t agree more, because I prefer to research and develop the most advanced technologies than to
    study how to implement "obsolete" technologies. With a PhD I am more likely to get interesting and challenging jobs in academia or industry.
    By pursuing a Ph.D., I believe I can gain the ability to achieve these goals.</p>

    <p>My undergraduate experience can be divided into the following three parts, which have given me self-discipline, resilience, skills in communication and planning,
        and prepared me for research.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Excellent grades</b>. No step is too small, and I have not slacked in my basic mathematics studies and programming training which bring me
        high ranking of <b>2/179</b> in my first five semesters. I have achieved excellent grades in several courses such as Data Structures (99), Probability Theory (95),
        in addition to self-study in statistical learning methods, Andrew NG: Deep learning, Stanford CS231n: Deep learning for Computer Vision,
        Stanford CS236: Deep Generative model and other machine learning related courses.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Strong mathematical modeling skills</b>. I am obsessed with using mathematical models to solve real-world problems.
        Studying mathematical modeling theory and methods, I have gained an understanding of optimization models, dynamic models and probabilistic models.
        I won awards such as the first prize in the Sichuan Region of the National Student Mathematical Modeling Competition 2021.
    </li>
    <li><p>
        <b>Experienced a complete training in scientific research</b>. I Joined Associate Professor Fan Zhou's team in the first semester of my junior year.
        I’ve worked with a senior on conditional generative models for 4 months and our goal is to apply DDPM, a powerful generative model,
        efficiently to speech enhancement tasks which traditionally handled by discriminative models. To address the challenge
        that generative models are difficult to sample from conditional distributions, we introduced a discriminative auxiliary network to get
        the prior distribution and re-derived the conditional probability formula, and after experiments we found that our model outperformed the
        baseline model by nearly 20 percentage points, and we have now completed the first draft of the paper. In addition, under the guidance of Associate
        Professor Deyuan Chen at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, I am researching the topic of object detection of dense crowds in point cloud data.
    </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The famous physicist Feynman wrote this sentence on the blackboard on the day he left this life:
    <i>“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”</i>, which implies the measure of thorough understanding. The deep generative model
    is the method that emerged from this idea. The relationship between deep generative models and common discriminative models can
    be analogous to the relationship between joint probability and conditional probability in probability statistics, and
    a discriminative model can be considered as a simple conditional generative model. Generative models can be applied not only
    to common discriminative tasks, but also to some challenging inverse problems and interesting generative tasks. Generative models
    usually face three challenges: representation, learning and inference, which are coupled with each other. In order to generate
    high quality and diverse samples, different models have different ideas on how to portray the data distribution, mainly including two types
    of approaches, representing edge p.d.f or representing the sampling process, corresponding to probabilistic graphical model-based approaches
    like Autoregressive model, Flow-based model, VAE, EBM andScore-based model, and GAN. There is still no model that can handle representation,
    learning and inference well at the same time and I agree that in the future we will find more powerful generative models.
</p>
<p>
    To sum up, I want to get my PhD in order to pursue an interesting and challenging career in
    academia or industry. My undergraduate experience has taught me the self-discipline and tenacity that will give me the confidence to
    make my own contributions to the field of machine learning especially deep generative model in the future.
